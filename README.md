# IncomePrediction
Project of INF 550
Based on Adult dataset provided by UCI machine learning repository(http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult).
Dataset contains 48842 (train=32561, test=16281) samples or 45222(train=30162, test=15060) if samples with unknown values are removed. 
All samples have in 14 features, including 6 with continuous value and 8 with nominal value.
Files include data preprocessing and three basic Machine Learning algorithms(Multinomial Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbor) based on Scikit-Learn packet.
